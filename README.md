# Easy Loadout (LSPDFR)

This is a small LSPDFR plugin that will automatically activate Easy Loadout when you go on-duty with LSPDFR and give you your default loadout.

## Requirements

* Rage Plugin Hook (Developed and tested on RPH v0.64.1234.15464)
* LSPD First Response (Developed and tested on LSPDFR v0.4)
* RageNativeUI (Developed and tested on RageNatuveUI v1.6.3)
* EasyLoadout.Core (Developed and tested on EasyLoadout v1.7)

NOTE: This does require you have Easy Loadout install, but does not require that it is loaded when you go on-duty to work.

#### LSPDFR Release

* [LSPDFR Release Page](http://www.lcpdfr.com/files/file/17259-easy-loadout/)


### NOTE FOR MODDERS

All of my GTA 5 mods are open source and if you're a modder that's wanting to either update an old mod that I've stopped updating or put your own spin on it feel free to use my code! I just ask that you simply give me some sort of credit somewhere on your release page!
